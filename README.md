 Summary: This project combines two pieces of sample code from the Google Books API
 developer documentation to create a simple, but powerful personal book viewer.
 The end user can 
 --search the Google books database 
 --select a title from a drop-down populated by the return values from the search
 --see the description of the selected title
 --click buttons to see
    --their personal notes for that volume (if they exist)
    --the Google reader preview version of volume, embedded in the page
 
 at any time, a new book may be selected from the current list, or a new search
 initiated.

 Google example code from the Google Books Developer documentation 
 was studied and adapted for this project. Specifically:
 https://developers.google.com/books/docs/viewer/developers_guide
 https://developers.google.com/books/docs/getting-started
 https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started
 
 This code should work as expected in a local environment, provided there is internet connectivity.
